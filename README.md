# Markdown-app (Vimnotes)
A **free** note taking app using vim key bindings.  
Visit the site here: [Vimnotes](https://vimnotes.vercel.app)

## Feature highlights

## Reason
I've been using [Simplenote](https://simplenote.com/) for a year now and i've been loving it, but the problem is that i wanted to be able to  
utilize simple vim key bindings for navigation and the godsent habit of typing `:w` to save a file while taking notes, so that's why  
I built vimnotes for my own personal use.

## User data
Since this is more of a pet project than an serious one, I would like for users to not use their personal credentials for signing up,  
you can use whatever email you want even if its a trash email.
